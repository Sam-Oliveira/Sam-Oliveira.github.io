Hi! I'm Samuel. I am a Ph.D. student at the [RLAI Lab](https://rlai.ualberta.ca/), supervised by [Rupam Mahmood](https://armahmood.github.io/) and affiliated with [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/). Previously, I graduated with a MSc in Machine Learning at University College London (UCL), and completed my undergraduate degree at Imperial College London. I am interested in creating decision-making systems that can learn continually. In particular, I am curious about studying these under a RL framework, as well as through improvements in current neural network architectures.
