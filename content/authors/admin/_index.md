I'm Samuel! I'm a Machine Learning Master's student at University College London. Previously, I graduated with First Class Honours from Imperial College London. I am interested in creating decision-making systems that can learn continually, adapting to new environments. In particular, I am curious about how to ensure that systems that can "learn forever" do so in a way that is safe and robust. I am currently doing my MSc Thesis on using denoising diffusion models for inverse RL in Ilija Bogunovic's Group at UCL.
