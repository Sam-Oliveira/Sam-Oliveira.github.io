            Investigated the use of diffusion models for Inverse Reinforcement Learning, in [Ilija Bogunovic's Group](https://ilijabogunovic.com/).
            - Created a model to learn a reward/guide function from a classifier-guided [trajectory-level diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09991). 
            - Benchmarked the framework against state of the art IRL methods in multiple Gymnasium environments.
            - Thesis available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPKvR1gQBin58dITgiBOXqsKdk6Zevg1/view?usp=drive_link). Code available [here](https://github.com/Sam-Oliveira/diffuser_irl).

            Undergraduate Thesis on creating a computationally efficient algorithm to predict eczema severity. Worked on it as part of my Thesis (October 2022 - June 2023), and as an Intern Research Assistant (June 2023 - September 2023). Work done at the [Tanaka Group](https://www.rtanakagroup.com/), and in collaboration with [Dr Rob Moss](https://robmoss.github.io/) of the University of Melbourne.
            - Implemented a framework using Sequential Monte Carlo methods to predict symptom severity in eczema patients.
            - The framework is capable of outputting predictions for each patient in under a second.
            - Taught a 2-hour tutorial on SMC methods for the entire lab group.
            - Currently writing it as a paper “EczemaPF: a computationally efficient algorithm for predicting the evolution of eczema severity” (to be published in Q1 2025).
