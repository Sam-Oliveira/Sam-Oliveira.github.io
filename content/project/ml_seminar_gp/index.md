The slides attached were used as part of an assessed presentation for the Machine Learning Seminar module at UCL. We summarised and reviewed the paper [Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Gaussian Process Regression is Ill-Posed](https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/22-1153.html) by Toni Karvonen and Chris J. Oates, for an audience composed of other members of the cohort.
